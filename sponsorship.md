I want to thank everyone who supported me and/or still supports me today.<br/>
What I do is largely due to you and your help, as well as to the inexhaustible
participation of users.

Below you can find a list, certainly incomplete, probably with some duplicates,
containing real-life names or nicknames, but which is a tribute to those who
have helped me to date.
