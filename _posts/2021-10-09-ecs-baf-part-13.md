Well, yeah, for some definitions of _shortly_ at least. :)

Here we are with the second part of the
[post](https://skypjack.github.io/2021-08-29-ecs-baf-part-12/) about sparse sets
and pointer stability.<br/>
We were left saying that _no policy is the best policy_ during iterations. Let's
see how to achieve it.

## Introduction

After using the ECS architecture for a while, I've to say that there are some
features that I'm more than willing to pay a few cpu cycles for whenever
possible.<br/>
Among the others, there is pointer stability. It helps to define some things in
a simple and intuitive way (such as hierarchies) and avoids the introduction of
subtle bugs due to reference invalidation. It also makes it trivial to interact
with third-party libraries or use your own components in external data
structures of any kind.

Sparse sets and independent pools models in general are pretty good at achieving
pointer stability in an elegant way. However, like everything else in computer
science, this too has a cost that must be assessed from time to time.<br/>
With the last post we saw how enabling pointer stability for a type that is
iterated mainly linearly isn't that good due to the _tombstone check_. However,
even a type worth enabling may find itself leading an iteration over multiple
components (for example, because it offers the _shortest_ pool) and therefore
introducing an extra cost in the loop.

To fully remove the costs due to the tombstone check, we've to take a step back
and start with our representation of the entity identifier.

## Entity identifier

Long time ago, [I talked](https://skypjack.github.io/2019-05-06-ecs-baf-part-3/)
about the fact that we can embed both the actual entity and its version in a
single identifier:

![baf13_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/136522253-fc5eea3b-db23-444f-a2bf-f093261b8d0e.png)

How many bits do we want to reserve for one or the other is an implementation
detail and I'll stick to what [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) does for
simplicity.<br/>
With this type of identifier in mind, we can introduce two distinct and equally
useful concepts: the _null entity_ and the _tombstone version_. Once again, the
implementation details are a matter of tastes and the following is just one of
the possibilities.

The null entity is a reserved value for the _entity part_ of an identifier:

![baf13_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/136522252-70646452-8436-410c-810e-fa4d3b851284.png)

The version doesn't really matter for a null entity, even though one can play
with the imagination to make the most of it and make good use of the countless
_identities_ of a null entity.<br/>
Similarly, the tombstone version is a reserved value for the _version part_ of
an identifier:

![baf13_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/136522250-adb0493f-6850-4c09-85b6-e2c987482198.png)

This time we have less freedom, as this is usually directly associated with an
entity to declare it as _unusable_.<br/>
A fully reserved identifier would therefore be the following:

![baf13_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/136522246-62ab529c-248b-4ea1-abee-84a5509b7ce8.png)

Let's see how all these are used in combination with a sparse set.

## Sparse sets and reserved values

### The null entity

With [this post](https://skypjack.github.io/2020-08-02-ecs-baf-part-9/) I
described a technique to reduce the cost of the lookup in a sparse set.<br/>
Briefly, the idea is that of combining the null entity (that is, an identifier
with a _nullified_ entity part) with the sparse array, so as to avoid checking
the packed array during a lookup. If the element in the sparse array is _null_,
we know for sure that there is no match in the packed array.<br/>
This is a simplified version of the resulting lookup function (it doesn't even
take in consideration the fact that the sparse array is probably paginated, as
described [here](https://skypjack.github.io/2020-08-02-ecs-baf-part-9/)):

```cpp
bool contains(entity_type entity) const {
    const auto index = entity_to_index(entity);
    return index < sparse.size() && sparse[index] != null;
}
```

As you can see, we don't need to visit the packed array to get the position of
an entity. This saves quite a lot of time during iterations, mainly because we
can discard elements earlier and reduce memory accesses.<br/>
Perhaps someone has also noticed that there is a problem with this approach but
we'll leave the details for a later paragraph. For years I've deliberately
_ignored_ it and it has never caused any problems. On the other side, it's also
true that this _problem_ prevents the implementation of certain features and I
can finally have them now that it's _fixed_ upstream.

### The tombstone version

In the [last post](https://skypjack.github.io/2021-08-29-ecs-baf-part-12/) I
instead described how we can use tombstones in the packed array to _mark_
elements as deleted without having to _swap-and-pop_ them.<br/>
This, combined with pagination, allows us to have pointer stability in any case,
with all that goes with it. However, it also affects our `contains`.<br/>
If you remember the details (I recommend rereading the previous post otherwise),
an implicit list is built that visits all the entities released up to a given
moment. This means that, if we find ourselves iterating a pool with tombstones,
all identifiers passed to the `contains` can have both a _special version_
**and** a potentially valid _entity part_.<br/>
In other words, we need to update the above function as follows:

```cpp
bool contains(entity_type entity) const {
    if(entity == tombstone) return false;
    const auto index = entity_to_index(entity);
    return index < sparse.size() && sparse[index] != null;
}
```

Otherwise, if we want to have an early exit, we can also review the loop at the
call site (forgive the pseudocode, luckily I never really had to write it):

```cpp
for(auto entity: pool.packed()) {
    if(entity != tombstone && check_all_other_pools(entity)) {
        // application code here
    }
}
```

In both cases, we've an additional branch and we know it: branches should be
avoided whenever possible in tight loops.<br/>
Fortunately, there also exists an alternative. The careful reader may have
already noticed that we have some bits left over.

## Pitfalls and wastes of a sparse array

### A weak `contains`

Let's take a second look at the `contains` function above:

```cpp
bool contains(entity_type entity) const {
    const auto index = entity_to_index(entity);
    return index < sparse.size() && sparse[index] != null;
}
```

This works fine as long as you've control over all storage objects. However, it
also has a problem.<br/>
Briefly, if we pass an identifier for an entity with version N and the set
contains that entity with version M, we are still returned true.

No one has even noticed this _problem_ in years of `EnTT` but think what sneaky
errors it could cause if users were managing their own pools.<br/>
Even more (but this time I'll leave this for a future article), think about what
features we could implement if there were a strict control also on the version
(still without having to access the packed array, so as not to lose
performance).

### Wasted bits

In the sparse array we put either the position of the entity inside the packed
array or a null entity (once converted to its underlying type).<br/>
Since the entity part of an identifier uses only the first N bits, we know that
we cannot have more than N elements in a set. Moreover, an index won't grow
beyond the first N bits. Finally, we also know that the null entity occupies
only the _entity part_ of an identifier.

Did you notice anything? Indeed, the _version part_ of an identifier is unused
inside the sparse array.<br/>
We're literally wasting a handful of bits on each entity when these could be so
useful to us instead.

## And finally came the version

I think at this point it's obvious how having the version of an entity inside
the sparse array can solve many problems, not only with regard to pointer
stability.<br/>
Also, it seems clear to me that there is room for it, so let's connect the dots.

The rules to follow are few and simple:

* Whenever you put the null entity in a slot of the sparse array, combine it
  with the tombstone version (that is, use your _reserved identifier_).

* In all other cases, slots must contain values such that their _entity part_ is
  the index of the element in the packed array while their _version part_ is the
  actual version of that element.

This is an image that should give you a rough idea of what I'm saying:

![baf13_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/136522254-1be6307f-90da-4cdf-9645-c2999594084e.png)

Once this is done, a single change to the `contains` function will fix both of
the above problems (again, I'm ignoring the pagination of the sparse array for
simplicity here, therefore expect a slightly more elaborated implementation from
real world cases):

```cpp
bool contains(entity_type entity) const {
    const auto index = entity_to_index(entity);
    return (index < sparse.size()) && ((~null & entity) ^ sparse[index]) < null;
}
```

How does this _thing_ work? Let's try to figure it out by examples.

### Case: valid identifier

For valid identifiers, `(~null & entity)` returns the _version part_ of the
entity. As a consequence, `((~null & entity) ^ sparse[index])` returns a value
that is less than `null` when the two versions match and higher than `null`
otherwise.<br/>
There are two cases in which the two versions don't match:

* The entity isn't part of the set and therefore the version set in the sparse
  array is the tombstone version.

* The entity in the sparse set has a different version from the one provided for
  the check.

From what we can see, we've already solved all our problems with entity versions
and the `contains` function doesn't even need to access the packed array. After
all, this was our goal, right?<br/>
So far, so good. Let's see what happens in all other cases now.

### Case: null entity

This is trivial. `entity_to_index(null)` returns an index that is always higher
than `sparse.size()`.<br/>
Therefore, null entities are rejected in all cases as it ought to be, no matter
what.

### Case: tombstone version.

In this case, `(~null & entity)` returns the tombstone version.<br/>
On the other hand, the entity part of our identifier can identify (by _mistake_)
an element that is either part of the set or not.

If the element is actually part of the set, `((~null & entity) ^ sparse[index])`
returns a value that is greater than `null` (once converted to an integral
value). Therefore, the resulting value is false.<br/>
This is due to the fact that we're combining a tombstone version with a valid
version and the two will differ at least for a bit.

The other case around is slightly more interesting instead. Remember that we put
a `null` entity with a tombstone version in the sparse array when the element
isn't part of the set. This means that `((~null & entity) ^ sparse[index])` will
return `null` while the whole expression evaluates to false.<br/>
This is due to the fact that the two versions will match while the entity part
of the identifier is actually `null`.

In other words, the test always fails for a tombstone version.

## No policy is the best policy

If it's true that pointer stability is a super nice feature, it's also true that
no policy is the best policy when it comes to iterating entities and
components.<br/>
We've finally messed up both our sparse set and our `contains` function,
completely removing the tombstone check (or rather, embedding it inside our
check in a hopefully less expensive form). At this point, the caller as well as
the sparse set can ignore whether or not we are using tombstones and always
perform the same test.<br/>
Even more, by playing with tombstone versions and `null` entities we'll also be
able to introduce new _modes_ in addition to pointer stability while maintaining
the `contains` function fully agnostic.

I'm pretty sure that the solution presented here is neither the only nor the
best possible one but it's still a solution.<br/>
Unfortunately I'm not that smart, but I more than willingly accept suggestions
to refine or replace this stuff, so get in on it!

Now we just have to talk about what allows us to do having solved the problem of
checking the versions inside the `contains` function... maybe next time? :)
