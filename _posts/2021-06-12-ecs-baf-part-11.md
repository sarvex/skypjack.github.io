Of the three most important models, there is one that I haven't talked about
much but that can offer much more than what has been said so far.<br/>
Let's take a closer look at the **big matrix** model, to find out how to make it
suitable even for more demanding software.

## Introduction

The _big matrix_ is quite simple in its basic implementation. The follwing image
can give a quick grasp of it:

![big_array](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/121778922-85ca6200-cb99-11eb-9045-f2078a937997.png)

It has the obvious advantage of being trivial to implement and to maintain.
Furthermore, it's very close to the way ECS is usually _explained_. We could say
that it's the closest practical representation to the theory.<br/>
Its key feature/downsides are:

* The best performance ever when it comes to adding and removing components.
* Positional access, the entity is also the index used to get its elements.
* Expensive iteration, the cost is roughly that of the number of systems
  multiplied by the number of entities.
* Risk to waste lof of memory because of many unused buffered elements.

Can we take a few steps forward from the basic implementation and make it more
interesting?<br/>
Remember that this model has _independent pools_ and often this aspect leaves a
lot of room for optimizations of all kinds.

## Pagination

The first thing to address is memory usage. Fortunately, there are many simple
solutions for that.<br/>
The most obvious one is to paginate the arrays of components and only create a
page when a component from that page is required.

For very dense pools, pagination may even increase memory usage due to the small
array of pointers to pages. However, most of the times it helps to save **lot**
of memory. Futhermore, since we have an independent pools model, we don't have
to paginate all arrays if we don't want to (even though I would suggest to avoid
this kind of _optimizations_ unless strictly required).<br/>
A nice to have side effect of pagination is that it also avoids the peaks due to
reallocations. In the worst case, we don't have anymore to copy a possibly large
array of components. Instead, we only have to copy a small array of pointers to
pages.

Iterations aren't usually affected by pagination in real world cases. It's true
that we now have to jump from a page to the other when iterating entities and
components. However:

* As we'll see, pagination can save a lot of elaboration time in many (**many**)
  cases.
* The small array of pointers to pages is likely to fit your cache and stay hot
  most of the time.
* Iterating a packed array **has** cache misses already, don't expect this to
  increase drastically that number.

On the other side, random access to components is the feature that suffers the
most from pagination. The guard to decide whether the component exists or not is
more _complex_ (we have now to also check if pages exist) and every access
requires a couple of jumps in memory.<br/>
Is this a problem? In general, it is not, unless you spend 90% of the time doing
random accesses to components. Moreover, I've a good new for you: pagination
gives us another (**very very interesting**) feature that can avoid them all.

### Pointer stability

The basic implementation of the big matrix is _almost there_ with pointer
stability. Components never move in fact, they occupy the same position withtin
their arrays. No swap-and-pop (sparse sets and archetypes), no full move between
tables (archetypes).<br/>
Still, a vector based implementation that does reallocate and moves all
components when we run out of memory isn't suitable for this purpose. However,
we want the cake and eat it, right? Here, pagination allows us to do that!

Even more, pagination gives it to us _for free_. Components have stable pointers
for their entire lifetimes once created and this is out of the box.<br/>
It gives us the possibility to correctly balance random accesses with direct
references, so as to better optimize this aspect and manage all costs. Moreover,
we can pass pointers around, easily create hierarchies and the like or even use
pointers with external data structures. In all cases, we are guaranteed that
they'll never break by design.

## Iteration

Let's go back to talking about iterations instead. In its basic implementation,
the big matrix has a cost equal to the number of systems multiplied by the
number of entities. At each step, we check whether the entity mask coincides
with that of the system and the requested data are provided if there is a
match.<br/>
So far, so good. Can we improve this? There are at least a couple of tricks as
obvious as they are simple to put into practice that can give us a boost in
terms of performance.

### Shortest set

Once again, remember that the big matrix has an independent pools model. Why
not exploit it then?<br/>
When iterating N components, the most obvious thing to do is to identify the
smallest pool (a negligible cost) and cut the iteration when it has reached the
given size.<br/>
Why does this work? Because entity N has its components at position N in each
pool with the big matrix. So, if the size of the smallest pool is `M` (`< N`
number of entities), we know it won't do any good to iterate the remaining
entities looking for a match, because it won't be found for sure.

This doesn't give much advantage when iterating very dense component arrays
assigned roughly to the same entities. However, for higher level systems, you
can save a lot of cpu cycles with this little trick.<br/>
All that remains is to combine it with pagination and the trick described in the
next section to push this model even harder.

### Fast forward

Pagination has a huge advantage: if no entity is assigned a component within a
page, the page isn't even created. In other words, the array of pointers to
pages contains _holes_, literally null pointers.<br/>
Now suppose we're iterating over our entities and components and have chosen the
pool of component `C` to drive the iteration. For sure, we know the page size of
this pool (let's say 1024), and therefore we know which entities represent the
_page turn_ during an iteration.<br/>
At this point, it will be enough to check the existence of the page in the pool
(or the pages in the pools, even better but it works only if all pools have a
common page size) when reaching the _sentinel entities_ and we'll be able to
jump forward thousands of elements in one go, avoiding to check if the bitmask
of those entities match the one required by the systems.

Of course, this won't give us much of an advantage if the pool driving the
iteration is mostly dense or contains all the pages. For example, imagine the
worst case, where only one element was created per page.<br/>
However, we also know that the average case is the most interesting and, all in
all, it's very likely that many systems (especially high-level ones) will be
able to skip large amounts of entities, allowing to gain several cpu cycles and
save many memory accesses.

### Hybrid solution

Finally, a few words about a variant that combines the above by adding an
additional parameter.<br/>
In fact, it's possible to choose the pool with the least number of elements
assigned instead of the one with the smallest extension, admitted and not
granted that the first information is available.<br/>
Or rather, we can iterate the pool with the least number of elements but still
stopping at the minimum extension (smallest entity among all pools).

Why should this give us an advantage? It's indeed debatable, but it could make
things even better in some cases.<br/>
Roughly speaking, the extension only tells us which pool contains the smallest
entity, allowing us to stop early. However, it doesn't tell us much about
pagination and how pages are used. On the other side, using the pool with the
fewer elements increases the possibility of encountering _holes_ for pages never
created so far, allowing us to skip many elements in one go.

Therefore, combining the two information minimizes the linear extension of the
iteration and on average increases the likelihood of jumping forward during the
iteration, thus maximizing performance.

## Conclusions

All in all, the simplicity of implementation and understanding of this model
makes it one of my favorites.<br/>
It's easy to understand and handle for novices, it has some features that other
models cannot offer, but it also has cons.

However, as we have seen, it's enough to take a few more steps than the basic
implementation to squeeze the big matrix and bring out more performance, while
also reducing memory usage.<br/>
All this makes the solution much more interesting and certainly usable in a
greater number of areas, easily putting it in competition with other models with
different characteristics.

As always, the perfect solution doesn't exist. It depends on our needs, on our
coding style and on our team, on how complex or accessible we want to make
everything and on a thousand other factors.<br/>
Should you decide to opt for the big matrix, I hope I've given you some ideas
to push it to its limits and save your memory.
